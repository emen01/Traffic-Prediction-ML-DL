# Traffic-Prediction-Model
Traffic prediction is a fundamental research problem in the realm of transportation studies.
Over the past decades, significant strides have been made in both theoretical approaches and empirical applications in order to reduce traffic congestion since it has become an increasingly issue in many urban environments.


This project will include the procedures and techniques of the application used in predicting traffic patterns.
It is divided into several critical components : data collection, data preprocessing, model development, results and evaluation.
